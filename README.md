# Keep Building

â€‹Keep Building is an entry to Trijam 265

You are tasked by your superior to quickly expand your city. HOWEVER he keeps making requirements stricter and stricter every SINGLE second. And Damn, those buildings be made of biodegradable foams or something, they get destroyed in seconds and you need to rebuild them as fast as possible ðŸ’€

Residential Buildings get you population (KEEP IT UP)
Commercial Buildings get you resources to build more buildings (Luckily, no inflation here)â€‹â€‹
â€‹Gosh, what do I do?â€‹

DEAL WITH IT, and GET YOUR PAYCHECK FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. LAYOFF IS REAL
